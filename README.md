# Perth-House-Price-Prediction-Project

In this notebook, I am glad to show you how to understand data and apply it to the Machine Learning model. Also, I'll show how to visualize Latitude and Longitude on a map, how to deal with categorical data and deal with distributions in numerical data. Then, I'll demonstrate how to work and test 7 ML models at a time and choose the best one. I hope you enjoy it! Finally we can see the results and their accuracy is 84%.

# Overview

1. First look at the DATA and simple EDA

2. Data Cleaning

3. Data Visualization(heatmap, histograms)

4. Visualizing Geographical Data (Visualizing how the price increase and decrease by location)

5. Creating new features based on the DATA. Experimenting with Attribute Combinations

6. Handling categorical and numerical data(creating preprocessor)

7. Models building and choosing the best model

8. Model Tuning

9. Results
